One last question - you have SQL table called "Salaries" with 3 columns - name, last_name and salary.
How would you retrieve the name and last_name entries where salary is above 1 million dollars and where the name ends with "rian"


SELECT name, last_name
FROM your_table_name
WHERE salary > 1000000 AND name LIKE '%rian';
